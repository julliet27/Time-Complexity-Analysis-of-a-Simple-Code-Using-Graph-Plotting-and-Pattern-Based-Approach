# Time-Complexity-Analysis-of-a-Simple-Code-Using-Graph-Plotting-and-Pattern-Based-Approach
Abstract :
Computation is a core topic in computer science. We code in Java, python, c++ or any other programming language for the backend and frontend of computers. To accomplish a task, a software system applies a collection of interconnected algorithms[6]. Most of the time, we measure the run time of a program using only our visual calculations. Our research shows that this visualization could be represented graphically and compute time complexity using a pattern based approach. Our research can find an infinite loop in some cases. Calculation can be represented in a complexity graph and analyze the time complexity. This study will help to pre-calculate before program execution, save running time, reduce computation, and create a new viewpoint in coding. The immediate goal is to visualize complexity in a programming language and is this possible to detect infinite loops from code. Another challenge for programmers often arises is to determine and detect infinite loops. Moreover, we can also calculate the complexity of recursive calls. However, in this challenging segment, there are two things that need to be addressed, i.e, space and time complexity. This is dependent on depth, number of calls and many other factors. We have looked upon the challenges regarding this.
